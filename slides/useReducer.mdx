# useReducer

Alternative to `useState`

---

```jsx smaller
import React, { useReducer } from "react";

const initialState = { count: 0 };

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "increment":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };

    case "decrement":
      return { count: state.count - 1 };

    default:
      throw new Error("Invalid action");
  }
};

const ReducerCounter = () => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You have clicked {state.count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "increment" })}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "decrement" })}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

<Notes>

- Provide a reducer function and an initial state.
  - Very similar to redux reducers.
- Good for complex state with multiple sub-values.
- Good when state updates rely on existing values.
- Easy to test in isolation.
- You can pass dispatch down to deep child components via useContext instead of callbacks.

```js smaller
const undosReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "undo":
      return {
        ...state,
        undos: state.undos.slice(0, -1),
        redos: [...state.redos].push(action.value)
      };

    case "redo":
      return {
        ...state,
        undos: [...state.undos].push(action.value),
        redos: state.redos.slice(0, -1)
      };

    case "change":
      return {
        ...state,
        undos: [...state.undos].push(action.value).slice(0, -20),
        redos: []
      };

    default:
      throw new Error("invalid action");
  }
};
```

<Notes>

- Complex state to manage undos/redos in 9Press.
- Reasons useReducer is good:
  - Always updating undos + redos at the same time.
  - Relies heavily on previous state.
  - Much easier to abstract this state logic into a reducer and keep complex logic out of the component.
