# What's a hook?

- A way to _hook in_ to react features
- They're just functions that you call in your React components

</Notes>

---

## Why?

- Don't need classes
- Better separation of code
- You can more easily abstract shared logic
- Less need for HOCs and render props

<Notes>

- You don't have to reach for classes
  - Adding state to a component is a one-liner: `useState()`
- Separates code by feature, not by lifecycle
- Can more easily abstract shared logic without wrappers
- Less need for HOCs and render props, simpler tree

</Notes>

## Rules of Hooks

- No nesting

---

```
if (thing) {
    useEffect(() => {
        doThing();
    });
}
```

<Notes>

- This is a very naive example but...

## Don't do this

</Notes>

---

```
useEffect(() => {
    if (thing) {
        doThing();
    }
});
```
